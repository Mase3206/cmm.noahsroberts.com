				Common Module Manager (CMM) is a basic package manager I made to install, remove, and update code I commonly use across many programs to centrally control installation and updates. I created it when I realized I began using one program, reformat.py, in a bunch of my projects. However, as I worked on each project, I made little edits to reformat that may or may not have been compatible with the other instances. Now, a framework to fix this already exists: pip. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/" target="_blank" title="Link: PyPI page for Python pip">Pip</a> is the built-in module manager for Python. However, the process of actually getting a module onto a pip repository is... difficult &mdash; but, because it's mostly for my use, I am not too concerned with getting it onto a pip repository.

				<strong>So I made my own!</strong> It's not perfect. I currently don't have any arm64 binaries (but I'm working on it!) and only one package can be passed at a time, but it's better than nothing. It has also been a good learning experience about where packages and other random variables (like package lists) are located in various operating systems. I am not going to go into detail about how to use CMM or the modules it updates here, because that's what the GitHub repository is for. You can find it at <a href="https://github.com/Mase3206/py-common-modules" target="_blank" title="Link: GitHub repository for py-common-modules">Mase3206/py-common-modules</a>.
